This is some code samples I have provided for my portfolio to showcase my Component Model Game Engine which I have used to create a game of Pong and Asteroids to demonstrate it working. 

This project utilises SDL2 for rendering, window management, and audio, otherwise all systems are coded by myself, and the interactions for each of these systems I have personally coded.
